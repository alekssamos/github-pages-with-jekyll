## hi all

I didn't expect it to be so cool.

I've always written HTML code **manually** and didn't even know it was possible to do that!6 I knew more precisely, but I thought it was complicated, or I would need to configure everything on my computer, download and install a lot of things.8A turned out to be no.

I'm happy!
